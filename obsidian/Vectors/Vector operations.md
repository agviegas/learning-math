### Vector - scalar product

$$a \vec v = \vec v a  = a \begin{bmatrix} v_1 \\ v_2 \\ v_3 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} a ~ v_1 \\ a ~ v_2 \\ a ~ v_3 \end{bmatrix} $$

The vector scalar product results in a new vector where each component has been multiplied by the scalar. It's **conmutative**. The 

___
The **additive inverse** of a vector $\vec v$ is $-\vec v$ . The vector $-\vec v$ has the same magnitude and opposite direction as $\vec v$. In other words, if $0$ is the zero vector:
$$\vec v + -(\vec v) = 0$$
___

Dividing a vector by a scalar is exactly the same if we consider that:

$$\frac {\vec v}{a} = \frac {1}{a} \vec v $$
