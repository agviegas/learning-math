An arithmetic value that represents a given quantity and is used for counting and calculations is called a **number**. Numbers can be classified in groups. Each group contains the previous one:

- **Natural numbers** are the ones used for counting and ordering: 1, 2, 3, 4, etc.
- **Integer numbers** also include negative values: 1, -1, 2, -2, etc.
- **Rational numbers** also include fractions / decimals: $\frac 1 2$, $-0.3$, etc.
- **Real numbers** also include numbers that can't be expressed as fractions: $\pi$, $e$, etc.

The study of **natural** and **integer** numbers is called **discrete math**, while the study of **real numbers** is called **continous math**. 

>Ironically, **real numbers** are a fiction: the universe is discrete and finite. We use **continous math** because it makes engineering easier: they are a convenient fiction. It's important to keep this in mind because computers, like the universe, are also discrete and finite. That has some consequences we might study later.

>For instance, C++ has various types of number: **short**, **int**, **float** and **double**. Some people might think that the difference is that **shorts** and **ints** are integers (discrete), whereas **floats** and **doubles** are real numbers (discrete). A **float** (4 bytes) can store approx. 4,294,967,296 values, while a **short** (2 bytes) only 65,537. Both are discrete, but the difference is **precission**.
