[[Polynomials]]**Summation notation** is a shorthand way to write the sum of a list of things. In other words, it's like a $for$ loop. It's expressed as the capital **sigma** letter. For example:

$$ \sum_{i=1}^6 a_i = a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + a_4 + a_5 + a_6 $$
The variable $i$ is the index, and the variable above is how many times to execute the summation. Similarly, we can use the capital **pi** letter to make a **product notation**:

$$ \prod_{i=1}^6 a_i = a_1 \cdot a_2 \cdot a_3 \cdot a_4 \cdot a_5 \cdot a_6 $$

**Interval notation** is used to refer to a subset of numbers. For instance, if $a$ and $b$ are real numbers, $[a,b]$ means the subset of all the real numbers between both and including both. We could exclude one of them using parenthesis: $(a,b]$ includes $b$, but excludes $a$.
