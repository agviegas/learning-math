**Algebra** is the branch of mathematics that studies the combination of elements according to certain rules. In general, it seeks to find the value of **variables** or **unknowns**. It includes areas like [[Polynomials|polynomials]], [[Equations|equations]] and [[Functions|functions]]. 

$$ 2 + x = 6 \rightarrow x = 4 $$

Algebra was originally conceived as a generalisation and extension of arithmetic. In modern algebra there are more advanced branches that are not (abstract algebra, homological algebra, exterior algebra, etc.).

**Evaluating** means giving values to all or some of the variables in an expression.

The combination of real numbers (constants) and literal numbers (variables) by means of operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, potentiation is called an **algebraic expression**.

An **algebraic term** is the sum of an algebraic expression. An algebraic term usually has 3 parts: 

- **coefficient**: real number that multiplies the variable.
- **base**: the variable.
- **exponent**: the degree of the variable.

Two algebraic terms are said to be **similar** when they have the same base and the same exponent.

An algebraic term that has no variable is called an **independent term**.
