**Arithmetic** is the area of mathematics that studies numbers and the [[Arithmetic operations|operations]] performed with them. 

**Identity numbers** are those that do not affect the operation sum and product respectively. The identity number of the sum is zero, and that of the product is 1.

The **opposite numbers** are those equidistant from 0. In practice, they are the positive and negative versions of the same number. For example, the opposite of 1 is -1. Therefore, zero is the only number that is its own opposite, and is therefore neither positive nor negative.
 
The **absolute value** of a number is its value regardless of its sign. It is represented by the notation between slashes. For example `|-2| == 2`. 
 
A **prime number** is a number greater than 1 that is divisible only by itself and 1, i.e. it has no multiples. On the other hand, a **compound number** is any number that is not prime; that is, it has more multiples.

Two integers are said to be **divisible** if the remainder of their quotient is zero.
 
A **factorisation** is the decomposition of a number into its prime factors, i.e. the prime numbers that, when multiplied together, give that number. For example, 45 has 5, 3 and 3 as factors (because 5 x 9 = 45).
 
The lowest number divisible by the two numbers is called the **least common multiple**. For example, the least common multiple between 4 and 6 is 12. It can be determined by multiplying the factors of both numbers (without repeating them between numbers): `4 = 2 x 2` and `6 = 2 x 3`, so the least common multiple is calculated as `2 x 2 x 3 = 12`. This is useful, for example, for adding and subtracting fractions from each other.

$$ \frac 3 4 + \frac 5 6 = \frac 9 {12} + \frac {10} {12} = \frac {19} {12} $$
 
The greatest common factor between two numbers is called the **maximum common divisor**. For example, the greatest common divisor of 12 and 18 is 6. It can be determined by finding the greatest common factors. For example, `12 = 2 x 2 x 3` and `18 = 2 x 3 x 3 `. Both numbers have the factors `2 x 3`, so their greatest common factor is 6.
 
A number that results from inverting the numerator and denominator of a fraction is called a **reciprocal number** or **inverse multiplicative number**. In the case of numbers that are not fractions, the denominator is 1. For example, the reciprocal of 3 (or 3/1) is 1/3. The product of a number and its reciprocal is always 1.
